## Exercise

As a group of 3 or 4 people, you'll have to make the HTML and CSS for an application. You can choose between the following two: [Discord](./assets/discord/) or [Battle.net Launcher](./assets/battlenet/). 

As you can see, there is more than one page for each application. You have to make sure that each page properly redirects to the others when the right *button* is clicked.

At the end of the deadline, we'll go over each group's project. So make sure it's published with GitHub pages.

### Rules of the game
* All pages of your project have to make use of the **same CSS file**.
* This exercise isn't finished until the deadline is reached. So keep making improvements until then!
* At the end of the deadline, every group member has a working copy of the project on their GitHub account.
